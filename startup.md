As a `user`, I want to be able to view my entire `employee directory` at once so that I have quick access to their information.

The `user` should be able to sort the `table` by at least one category, and `filter` the users by at least one property.

## Objects
* User
* Employee Directory
* User Info
* Table
* Catagory
* Filer 
* Property

## Components
* Header
* Filter
* Table
    • Properties (Table headers)
    • Data (`User` records)
